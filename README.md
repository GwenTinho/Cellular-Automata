# Cellular-Automata

  

This experimental app includes many types of:

- Array Operations

- Grid Operations

- Cellular automata (with preset rulesets that are easy to edit)

- Sandpiles (Abelian Sandpile Model, also lets you make identities and infinite piles)

- A version of Conway's Game Of Life encoding the cells in an array of ints (Thx to Maar for that idea)

- Some Concrete Math Functions (GCD, powFast, modBase2)

- A file full of binary operations on int32's
